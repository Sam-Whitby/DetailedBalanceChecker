# DetailedBalanceChecker

Symbolic and numerical checker for the detailed balance condition in MCMC algorithms.
Written in Mathematica, run from the terminal via `wolframscript`.
Produces a full diagnostic PNG report for each algorithm tested.

## What it does

Given an MCMC algorithm and an energy function the checker:

1. **Builds the decision tree** by exhaustive BFS over all random-call sequences the algorithm can make. The state space is discovered automatically from a single seed state.

2. **Checks detailed balance exactly** — constructs the symbolic transition matrix and verifies T(i→j)·π(i) = T(j→i)·π(j) for every pair using `FullSimplify` with β > 0. Both β and all energy parameters are kept symbolic throughout. The result is an exact PASS or FAIL.

3. **Runs a numerical MCMC simulation** with genuine random numbers and compares the visited-state histogram to the Boltzmann distribution (KL divergence).

4. **Renders a PNG report** showing decision trees, symbolic transition matrix, detailed-balance pair table, and simulated vs Boltzmann scatter plot.

## How it works internally

The algorithm is called with native Mathematica random functions (`RandomInteger[]`, `RandomReal[]`, etc.), which are intercepted during BFS. Each call is replaced by a deterministic value from a bit tape, making the algorithm's execution path fully reproducible.

- `RandomInteger[]` or `RandomInteger[1]` — reads one bit; contributes ½ to path weight.
- `RandomReal[] < p` — reads one bit; contributes p (accept) or 1−p (reject) to path weight.
- T(i→j) = **sum of path weights** over all bit sequences taking state i to state j.

### Supported random calls

| Call | Behaviour during BFS |
|---|---|
| `RandomReal[]` | deferred token; fires as accept/reject when compared with `< p` |
| `RandomInteger[]` or `RandomInteger[1]` | reads one bit |
| `RandomInteger[{lo, hi}]` | reads k=⌈log₂(hi−lo+1)⌉ bits; out-of-range silently discarded |
| `RandomInteger[n]` | reads k=⌈log₂(n+1)⌉ bits |
| `RandomChoice[list]` | reads k=⌈log₂(n)⌉ bits |

Calls that cannot be intercepted (abort): `RandomVariate`, `AbsoluteTime`, `SessionTime`, `Now`.

## Writing an algorithm file

An algorithm file is a plain `.wl` file containing exactly four things:

```mathematica
energy[state_] := ...      (* bare energy, no beta *)

Algorithm[state_] := ...   (* MCMC move using native random calls *)

seedState = ...             (* any valid starting state *)
numBeta   = ...             (* inverse temperature, numeric *)
```

Optionally, include symbolic energy parameters:

```mathematica
symParams = <|"eps" -> {ε1, ε2, ...}, "couplings" -> {J1, ...}|>
```

When `symParams` is present, the checker keeps site energies and coupling strengths as unassigned symbols throughout the symbolic check, then assigns random numerical values for the MCMC run. This allows `FullSimplify` to verify detailed balance across **all** possible energy values simultaneously.

### Rules for `energy`

- Takes a state, returns a scalar (the bare energy, no β).
- Must be deterministic — no random calls.
- May use symbolic (unassigned) parameters listed in `symParams`.
- β must NOT appear inside `energy`; it is injected by the checker via `Block`.

### Rules for `Algorithm`

- Takes a state, returns a new state (or the same state to stay put).
- Uses `RandomInteger[]`, `RandomReal[]`, and/or `RandomChoice[]` for all randomness.
- Use `MetropolisProb[dE]` for the Metropolis acceptance probability:
  ```mathematica
  MetropolisProb[dE] = Piecewise[{{1, dE ≤ 0}, {Exp[-β dE], dE > 0}}]
  ```
  β remains symbolic during tree-building; the checker assigns it numerically for MCMC.
- Custom acceptance criteria work as long as β stays symbolic:
  ```mathematica
  BarkerProb[dE_] := 1 / (1 + Exp[β * dE])
  ```

### Minimal example

```mathematica
(* L=4 ring, 1 particle, Kawasaki hop + Metropolis *)
L = 4
eps = {\[Epsilon]1, \[Epsilon]2, \[Epsilon]3, \[Epsilon]4}
symParams = <|"eps" -> eps|>

energy[s_Integer] := eps[[s]]

Algorithm[s_Integer] := Module[{dir, nbr, dE},
  dir = RandomInteger[];
  nbr = Mod[s + If[dir == 0, -1, 1] - 1, L] + 1;
  dE  = energy[nbr] - energy[s];
  If[RandomReal[] < MetropolisProb[dE], nbr, s]
]

seedState = 1
numBeta   = 1
```

Run with:
```bash
wolframscript -file check.wls my_algorithm.wl
```

## examples2 — self-contained algorithm files

| File | System | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `kawasaki_1d_swap_pass.wl` | L=4 ring, 3 labeled particles, swap Kawasaki, pairwise coupling | **PASS** |
| `kawasaki_1d_drift_fail.wl` | L=4 ring, 3 particles (sorted occupancy), rightward drift, flat energy | **FAIL** (symbolic), PASS (numerical) |
| `kawasaki_2d_pass.wl` | 3×3 torus, 3 particles, standard Kawasaki | **PASS** |
| `kawasaki_2d_fail.wl` | 3×3 torus, 3 particles, unbalanced particle selection | **FAIL** |

### What each example demonstrates

**`kawasaki_1d_swap_pass.wl`** — Kawasaki swap dynamics with 3 **labeled** (distinguishable) particles on a 4-site ring. State = length-4 list recording which particle label (1, 2, or 3) occupies each site, or 0 for empty. The algorithm picks a random bond; if both sites are occupied, the two particles swap positions and Metropolis acceptance is applied. Energy depends on which pair of labels are adjacent (three symbolic coupling constants J12, J13, J23). Because the hole never moves under pure swap dynamics, the reachable state space from seed {1,2,3,0} is the 6 permutations of labels 1, 2, 3 at sites 1–3 (all with the hole fixed at site 4). Proposal is symmetric and Metropolis is correct → **PASS**.

**`kawasaki_1d_drift_fail.wl`** — Deterministic rightward current on the sorted-occupancy representation (hole moves left one step per step, equivalent to all particles drifting right). Energy is flat (= 0), so the Boltzmann distribution is uniform over the 4 sorted states and the MCMC histogram matches it perfectly (KL ≈ 0). Yet the symbolic check detects the persistent current (T(i→j) = 1, T(j→i) = 0 for each cyclic pair). Demonstrates that the numerical check is necessary but not sufficient.

**`kawasaki_2d_pass.wl`** — Standard Kawasaki on a 3×3 torus with rational site energies. Pick a random particle (rejection sampling over 3), pick a random direction (N/S/E/W), apply Metropolis. With 84 states the symbolic check requires several minutes; most state pairs have T = 0 trivially, so only ~300 adjacent pairs need `FullSimplify`. Includes `PlotState` and `PlotTransition` helper functions for visualising the 2D lattice from a Mathematica notebook.

**`kawasaki_2d_fail.wl`** — Same 2D system but with a subtly broken particle selection. Instead of the correct uniform `RandomInteger[{0,2}]`, the algorithm uses a three-level if-tree where rank-1, rank-2, and rank-3 particles consume 1, 2, and 3 bits respectively. This produces unequal proposal probabilities (1/2, 1/4, 1/4 for the three branches — but the rank-3 branch has an extra unused bit that doubles its effective weight relative to rank-2). Whenever a hop changes a particle's rank in the sorted state the forward and backward move draw from different proposal weights, breaking detailed balance. The violation is subtle: all particles can be proposed, direction selection is correct, Metropolis is correct — only the bit-depth imbalance in the selection tree reveals the flaw.

### Visualising the 2D lattice

After running the 2D examples, call the helper functions from a Mathematica notebook:

```mathematica
Get["examples2/kawasaki_2d_pass.wl"]

(* Print current state as ASCII grid *)
PlotState[{1, 5, 9}]

(* Show a transition *)
PlotTransition[{1, 5, 9}, {2, 5, 9}]
```

Grid layout (site numbering):
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

## Practical limits

- **States**: discovered automatically; keep to ≤ 10–15 for fast results. The 2D example with 84 states is feasible (most pairs are non-adjacent and resolve immediately).
- **Bit depth**: `MaxBitDepth=20` covers most algorithms.
- **FullSimplify**: the most expensive step. With symbolic energy parameters, PiecewiseExpand resolves Metropolis conditions branch-by-branch using exact algebra. For the 2D examples (numeric energies) this is faster.
- **Flat-energy caveat**: if all energies are equal the Boltzmann distribution is uniform, so KL ≈ 0 for any algorithm — even non-reversible ones. The symbolic DB check catches this; the numerical check is uninformative on flat landscapes by design.
